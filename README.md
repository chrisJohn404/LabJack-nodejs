LabJack-nodejs
==============
'LabJack-nodejs' makes LabJack's [LJM library](http://labjack.com/ljm) available for node.js.  The library uses [ffi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi) to link to the appropriate library file (LabJackM.dll, LabJackM.dylib, or LabJackM.so) which must be installed with one of [LabJack's installers](https://labjack.com/support/software/installers/ljm).  Currently, installers are available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux 32-bit & 64-bit, and a few builds for ARMv6 and ARMV7 architectures.

This library exposes the LJM driver slightly different than our standard [LJM Library](https://labjack.com/support/software/examples/ljm) wrappers because it was created primarily for use in [Kipling](https://labjack.com/support/software/applications/kipling).  If this library were to be re-written it would be split into two modules, one that directly exposes the LJM Library functions, and another that performs some of the abstractions.  A brief summary of how this library exposes the LJM Library:
 * Created two different objects, device.js and driver.js, that can be imported individually.
 * Was created to function much like the [LabJack Python driver](http://labjack.com/support/labjackpython) for LabJack UD devices.
 * For more information about what each function does, please look at the LabJackM.h file that can be downloaded & installed from LabJacks [Software & Driver](http://labjack.com/support/software) page.

Currently this wrapper only supports the [T4](http://labjack.com/products/t4), [T7](http://labjack.com/products/t7), [T7-Pro](http://labjack.com/products/t7), [Digit-TL](http://labjack.com/products/digit), and [Digit-TLH](http://labjack.com/products/digit) LabJack devices. (Which are low cost, high-quality, multifunction USB / Ethernet / 802.11b/g WiFi DAQ devices.)  Devices using the UD library (Windows only) aka U3, U6, and UE9 are not supported.  Additionally, the U12 is not supported.

Notes:
------

If you are trying to perform device IO, consider looking at the [ljswitchboard-ljm_device_curator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ljswitchboard-ljm_device_curator) project.  It makes several more device abstractions and wraps this library in a promise interface.
If you are trying to scan for devices consider using the [ljswitchboard-device_scanner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ljswitchboard-device_scanner) module.

Requirements
------------

* LabJack's [LJM Library](https://labjack.com/support/software/installers/ljm).
* Ability to build native modules, for Windows this requires Visual Studio.
* Look at the [ffi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi) library for more requirements.
* Look at the [node-gyp installation notes](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for various requirements.
* Also look at the [ref](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ref) library as it too is a native module.
* Look at the windows [nodejs-guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#compiling-native-addon-modules) page for compiling native addon modules. 
* Make sure that you have node-gyp installed by running the command "node-gyp" if not:
```bash
$ npm install -g node-gyp
```

Installation
------------

Make sure that node-ffi and ref can be installed, it may be wise to create a dummy project and invoke:
``` bash
$ npm install ffi
```
before trying to install LabJack-nodejs.  Once you can do that simply install via npm:
``` bash
$ npm install labjack-nodejs
```

Installation notes for Windows:
-------------------------------
Make sure that [node-gyp is properlly installed](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21365714/nodejs-error-installing-with-npm).
Performing the standard npm install command will fail on Windows.  It will hopefully complain about not having proper "TargetFrameworkVersion or PlatformToolset variables not being set.  If this is true, set them:
"npm install --msvs_version=2012" or 2013.

This hint came from someone building [couchbase](http://www.bitcrunch.de/install-couchbase-node-js-windows-8-machine/)

For higher/newer versions of node, visual studio 14.0 is required aka msvs_version=2015.

Also, consider using the command "npm config set msvs_version 2015 --global" instead of the non global version [node-gyp install issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/802).

## General Information (Async vs sync function calls)
This driver wrapper was created supporting both synchronous and asynchronous function calls to support both functional and object-oriented programing styles. The general format is shown below:
```javascript
//Synchronous syntax:
try{
	const result = exampleFunctionSync(arg1);
}catch(err){
	//see detailed information about the error and where it came from in the code stack
	console.trace(err);
	//you can handle the err here.
	//if you want the error to exit the node program, simply do not use the try catch
}

//Asynchronous syntax (requiring function callbacks):
exampleFunction(
	arg1,
	function(err) {
		console.log('error', err);
	},
	function(result) {
		console.log('success', result);
	}
);
```

### Basic Usage (Hello World, reading an analog input):


```javascript
//Require LabJack-nodejs
var ljn = require('labjack-nodejs');

//Device object (to control a LabJack device)c
var createDeviceObject = ljn.getDevice();

//Device object (to control a LabJack device)
var device = new createDeviceObject();

// Open a device
try{
	device.openSync();
}catch(err){
	//see detailed information about the error and where it came from in the code stack
	console.trace(err);
	//you can handle the err here.
	//if you want the error to exit the node program, simply do not use the try catch
}

// Read an analog input
try{
	console.log('AIN0:', device.readSync('AIN0'));
}catch(err){
	//see detailed information about the error and where it came from in the code stack
	console.trace(err);
	//you can handle the err here.
	//if you want the error to exit the node program, simply do not use the try catch
}

// Close the device
device.closeSync();
```

### Available functions in the labjack-nodejs library:
After creating a labjack-nodejs library reference:
```javascript
var ljn = require('labjack-nodejs');
```
you get access to several attributes, the two most important ones are:
* ljn.device()
* ljn.getDevice()
* ljn.getDeviceRef()
* ljn.driver()
* ljn.getDriver()

Look at the lib/labjack_nodejs.js file for what gets exported.  There are a few subtle differences between the functions in terms of creating new objects.

In general, LJM functions that require the passing of a device handle are implemented in the device object.  Functions that are device-agnostic are implemented in the driver object.

### Available Functions in the device object (device.js):
After creating a device object:
```javascript
var device = new createDeviceObject();
```
several functions are made available:

Device Opening/Closing
* open/openSync
* close/closeSync
* getHandleInfo/getHandleInfoSync

Reading:
* readRaw/readRawSync
* read/readSync
* readArray/readArraySync
* readMany/readManySync

Writing:
* writeRaw/writeRawSync
* write/writeSync
* writeArray/writeArraySync
* writeMany/writeManySync

Both Directions:
* rwMany/rwManySync

Special/Streaming
* readUINT64/readUINT64Sync
* streamSettings
* streamStart/streamStartSync
* streamRead/streamReadSync
* streamStop/streamStopSync

#### open():
